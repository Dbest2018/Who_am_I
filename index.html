    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi I'm Ibrahim, an aspiring Front-end developer.<br />
         I do have experience working with production level applications(with React, Typescript, Semantic UI, nodeJs, express and django)<br /> 
        as I was an intern at KPMG for a year in the innovation department.<br />
        I love football(soccer), used to play in college for the team, and I have a very simple way of living my life,<br />
         which is the golden rule, do onto others what you want to be done to you.<br />
    </p>
